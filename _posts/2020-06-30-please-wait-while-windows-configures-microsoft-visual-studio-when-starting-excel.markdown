I got this dialog ("Please wait while windows configures Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2013") on every Excel (2010) start up shortly after I had installed Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition. In my case it delayed the Excel start-up for several minutes. In order to get rid of the quite annoying dialog I just created a new directory under C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\URTInstallPath_GAC. To do so just run the command below from an elevated command- or PowerShell prompt:

[code language="powershell" light="true"]
mkdir C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\URTInstallPath_GAC
[/code]
