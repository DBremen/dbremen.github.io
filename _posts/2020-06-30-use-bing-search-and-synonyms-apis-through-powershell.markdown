This is a short post on how to use the [Bing Search](https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/search) and [Bing Synonyms](https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/synonyms) APIs via PowerShell (I would like to credit [this post](http://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/Accessing_the_Bing_Search_API_v2_using_PowerShell) from Svendsen Tech as it really helped me to understand the usage). Both APIs can be  used free of charge for up to 5,000 transactions per month. Prerequisite for the usage of the APIs is a valid subscription verified through an account key. Subscribing to the APIs and retrieving the account key can be done through the [Micrsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=bing). The usage of the APIs through PowerShell is pretty easy:
