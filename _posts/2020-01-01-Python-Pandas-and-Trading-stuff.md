## Code Blocks

Here's an example of a CSS code snippet written in GFM:

```css
#container {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

Indentation matters. Be sure the indent of the code block aligns with the first non-space character after the list item marker (e.g., `1.`). Usually this will mean indenting 3 spaces instead of 4.

1. Do step 1.
2. Now do this:
   
   ```ruby
   def print_hi(name)
     puts "Hi, #{name}"
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
   ```
        
3. Now you can do this.

## GitHub Gist Embed

GitHub Gist embeds can also be used:

```html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mmistakes/77c68fbb07731a456805a7b473f47841.js"></script>
```

Which outputs as:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mmistakes/77c68fbb07731a456805a7b473f47841.js"></script>
